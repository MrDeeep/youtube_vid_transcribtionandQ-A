            "Hello and welcome and I can tell you it was a dry walk to the Gantry today. No rain in sight I'm Derek Ray and I'm joined for expert analysis by Stuart Robson And we can't wait for this one to start with justifiable cause it's Real Madrid taking on Real Madrid Thanks Derek Well this should be a decent game today. Both managers will have a game plan. both teams have a certain style of play and both sides will want to start quickly. I'm looking forward to this Gman Kane and Real Madrid Had the ball again Shevchenko and a chance for them to nudge in front. not out of the woods yet a very effective play and they might be on to something. Venicius J and real doing well to win it back and it will be a free kick to Real Madrid Jude Bellingham W Prous Here here's Kane Venicius, but he tried in vain to get himself back on side. Well, he needs to show greater awareness there and hold on to the ball a fraction longer. Ramos GES Puol and the ball with Shevchenko Shevchenko, How could he take them on and beat them? Can he put them in front and a goal? Now they have their opener and now they can celebrate. well. As you can see, this is a wonderful strike. He makes the perfect connection and he has so much Pace on it it's a great goal. Roal did well to regain control of the ball. Venicius Jun and nearing the halime interval Real Madrid Hold the edge here. Stuart How about your assessment of what you've seen from them? Oh big chance. Oh great defending Now Options are plenty M He prevented it from going over the line Harry Kane and the electronic board showing one additional minute and the whistle is sounded for halime. In this game, the ball moving. Again, Ra have the lead, but they won't be taking anything for granted. Venicius Jr Gman Shevchenko and Benzema at the Hub of this attack, let's see what he does next. and let's give credit to the [Applause] defending. Vus J and Real Madrid Have it back [Applause] Now Venicius J Gerard Karim Benzema Chevchenko [Applause] Ginola misfiring completely. Yeah, he's gone for power, but the contact was never right. It's a poor effort really. Ezri Cona Now Griezman. Well, a good tackle [Applause] Ramirez onto Gerard Gerard Oh big opportunity. Well, they needed a bit of goalkeeping inspiration and that's what they've got. Well, that just about keeps his team in this one. but are they good enough to go and get the equalizer and it goes to increase their advantage and will that be the goal that ends up secing in for them? Well, here's the replay and what a well delivered cross. This is perfectly placed and it ends up with a fairly simple finish. Certainly not much the goalkeeper can do about that and the ball is moving again. 2N is how it stands. Ezri Cona: Bellingham Well, we've entered the the final five minutes, really committed himself to the tackle and a throw in now. Jude Bellingham Real Madrid Have been awarded the free kick. Understandably, he wanted to give it a go, but straight at the keeper and that is that the end of the game. It goes into the books as a win for Real Madrid What did you think of their overall performance? Well, Derek It was fairly comfortable in the end because they were tactically Superior had better individuals and were always a threat going forward. It was a really good performance and a good result as well.\n"
